Submitted by: **Nasradin Kewden**

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [x] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

    [Think Like A Programmer by V. Anton Spraul,
    Learning Web Design by Jennifer Niederst,
    w3schools (https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp)]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

    [My first attempt at creating the logic for the guess function presented the biggest challenge. Despite the challenges, it was a great experience, since I learned from every failure. I would run into obstacles occasionally, but they stimulated my mind because trying to solve them gave me satisfaction. Although it was frustrating at the beginning, I knew that I would eventually learn from it. Taking a step-by-step approach to understanding the logic chart helped me overcome this challenge. It was crucial that I understood every scenario in the flow chart as I visualized it. Additionally, I did some research to find a book that could help me improve my problem-solving skills and came across Think Like A Programmer by V. Anton Spraul. It teaches systemic problem-solving in an easy-to-follow manner that’s great for beginners. By utilizing these two resources and my dedication, I was able to overcome that challenge through trial and error. Another challenge that took me some time to resolve was linking the CSS file with the index HTML file. I developed the memory game in VSCode, my favorite code editor. Having spent quite some time trying different solutions, I turned to the website w3schools for assistance. By specifying …/ in front of the CSS file location, it worked like a charm. At the end of the day, I have gained knowledge that can be applied to future situations as a result of these roadblocks.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

    [There are many devices today that people use to view websites. Smartphones, laptops, and other devices with varying screen sizes can be used to view websites. In the case of building a website for only PC users, will mobile users see the same screen size or will there be problems? At the end of my memory game, I had this thought because I wanted to play it on my phone. I am also curious about where the information about the website’s passwords and usernames are stored. If I wanted to host a website with basic logins which technologies would I use? I’ve heard of SQL, Django, and PHP and I wonder how they play a role in the functionality of a website. I know their main role is in the backend, but how are they specifically used in the backend? How do they increase the capabilities of a website?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

    [If I had a few more hours to work on this project to add more features, I would make the game more interesting by moving one game button for each guess. So when a player guesses their first button, that specific button will be moved to a different location. This is a great exercise to increase the difficulty. Another feature that I would add is making a rhythm with the sound frequency to link with the guessing. A good example is the piano game, and in this case, the farther your guess the longer the rhythm. This will make the game more immersive for the players and will off balance the difficulty of the extra features if implemented. One last feature I would spend time on is increasing the player's guess by more than one each guess segment. So instead of adding one extra guess each time, I would add maybe 2 or 3 each time the players guesses the next button. This will increase the diffuclty by a lot since the player needs to remember multiple button every new guess]
